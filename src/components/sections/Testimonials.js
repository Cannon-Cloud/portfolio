      "Clarence and I worked together at Verizon for almost four years. During that time, we shared an office and would often compete to attain the #1 spot during our call and sales blitzes. Clarence is a competitive and skilled sales leader who strives to give his customers and clients the best service to wow them into a long-term partnership. He was the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù person on his team for help and he would often assist me and my team with complex strategies to win and grow our business. I wish Clarence the best on his new venture and know his new set of customers will be delighted with his consultative style of sales professionalism. üëç",
